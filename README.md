# Waydroid Installer for MX Linux 23.6

A simple script to install and run [Waydroid](https://waydro.id) on MX Linux 23.6.  
Includes dependencies, Liquorix kernel, UFW configuration, and initialization steps.

Repository: [differentfun/waydroid_initializer](https://github.com/differentfun/waydroid_initializer)

## 📦 What It Does

- Installs required packages and dependencies  
- Adds the official Waydroid repository  
- Installs the Liquorix kernel (6.2.14) compatible with MX Linux (from later kernels they senselessly removed the 'binder' module, so goodbye to Waydroid.) 
- Configures UFW to enable network forwarding (DHCP and DNS ports)
- Download and compile Weston 9 (to get Weston Launch)
- Provides a two-stage installation process (pre‑reboot install and post‑reboot init)  
- Includes manual launch instructions for running Waydroid via Weston

## ⚙️ Requirements

- MX Linux 23.6 (based on Debian)  
- Internet connection  
- `sudo` privileges

## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/differentfun/waydroid_initializer.git
```
```bash
cd waydroid_initializer
```
```bash
chmod +x waydroid_initializer.sh
```
```bash
./waydroid_initializer.sh
```

When prompted, choose 1 for installation (pre‑reboot).
Reboot your system.
Run the script again and choose 2 for Waydroid initialization.
Optionally, choose 3 in the script to display manual run instructions.

After installing the Liquorix kernel, reboot and verify with:
```bash
uname -r
```

Weston is used as the minimal Wayland compositor to display Android UI.
To launch Waydroid manually, follow instructions shown by selecting option 3, or use:

```bash
weston &
```

From Weston open the terminal and: 
```bash
sudo true
```
```bash
sudo waydroid container start &
```
```bash
sudo waydroid session start &
```
```bash
waydroid show-full-ui
```
